### NOTE
If you are using this, use it sparingly. There are way more efficient tools that achieve the same effect. Two of them on the top of my head is the Particle System (Shuriken) and the VFX Graph (HDRP only to my knowledge).

osu!trigen-importable is a rewrite of osu!trigen.
This rewrite allows the generator to be imported into any Unity project.
It also changes the entire generation system to be easily read and modifiable.
I also find the way simpler. (but lets face it, **I** did this)


This was upgraded to Unity version 2019.3.5f1  
The project should be able to be upgraded into the 2020 version.
