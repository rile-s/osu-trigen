osu!trigen-importable is a rewrite of osu!trigen.
This rewrite allows the generator to be imported into any Unity project.
It also changes the entire generation system to be easily read and modifiable.
I also find the way simpler. (but lets face it, **I** did this)


This was upgraded to Unity version 2019.3.5f1  
The project should be able to be upgraded into the 2020 version.
