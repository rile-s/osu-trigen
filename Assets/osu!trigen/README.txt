This version of osu!trigen has changed alot from version 1.4 in the original.

The big difference being that this version allows you to import the trigen into any project.
All of the features from version 1.4 has either been removed or revamped.

osu!trigen is a full rewrite of osu!trigen.
Much of the code from the original has been stripped off and replaced with simpler code. (At least in my opinion.)
This does mean many features from the orginal are missing in this verion.
Removed features will probably be added back in a later build.

If you want to access the scripts at anytime.
You must include riles.trigen into your script.

Features:
Basic Customization (Speed, Size, etc...)
Revamped Tri direction. Triangles can now move in any direction. (Except on their Z axis.)
Generator width. (You can make streams made of triangles now)
Generator limit. You can almost make them infinitly long. (Assuming you have a decent computer)
Multiple Triangle colors!
No limits on triangle settings. (excluding engine limits)
Triangle recycling. (No more destorying objects)

Removed:
The music player and speed syncing.
Discord support. (Why was there rich presence?)
Easy texture replacement. (This takes place inside the editor)
The UI.

Limitations (THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT):
There can only be one trigen at anytime. (This includes additive scenes)
This is due to there only being one set of settings.
This will soon be changed to include multiple sets.

Also, keep use to a minimum.
The generator is very CPU heavy.
This can single handedly cause a massive frame drops during gameplay.
About 50 - 100 Tris can eat up about 100 frames in the sample scene. (On a Ryzen 3 2200G on base speeds)
